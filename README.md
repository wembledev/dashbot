# DashBot

A real-time dashboard that gives you a window into your [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/) AI assistant — chat, monitor status, and interact with agent-driven cards from any browser.

* **Connected:** Plugs into your OpenClaw gateway via the [dashbot-openclaw](https://github.com/wembledev/dashbot-openclaw) plugin for live two-way communication.
* **Mobile-first:** Designed for Tesla browsers, phones, and tablets — works great on desktop too.
* **Extensible:** Widget system for custom status panels, agentic cards, and integrations.

## How It Works

    Gateway["🤖 OpenClaw Gateway"]

    Dashboard <--> DashBot
    DashBot <--> Plugin
    Plugin <--> Gateway
```

Your OpenClaw AI agent runs on the gateway. The [dashbot-openclaw](https://github.com/wembledev/dashbot-openclaw) plugin connects it to DashBot over WebSockets, streaming chat messages, status updates, and agentic card interactions in real time. Open the dashboard in any browser to see what your agent is up to.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 4.0+
- Node.js 22+
- SQLite3

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wembledev/dashbot.git
cd dashbot
bin/setup              # install deps, prepare DB
```

Or step by step:

```sh
bundle install && npm install
cp .env.example .env
bin/rails db:prepare
```

Configure `.env`:

```env
DASHBOT_PASSWORD=<pick a password>
DASHBOT_API_TOKEN=<generate with: ruby -e "require 'securerandom'; puts SecureRandom.hex(32)">

# Optional but recommended when accessing from phone/Tailscale.
# Used for QR login links + host authorization.
DASHBOT_PUBLIC_URL=https://<your-tailnet-host>.ts.net
```

### Run

```sh
bin/dev                # Rails on :3000, Vite HMR on :5173
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and log in.

### Connect Your Agent

DashBot connects to your AI assistant via the [dashbot-openclaw](https://github.com/wembledev/dashbot-openclaw) plugin. Install the plugin into your OpenClaw gateway, point it at your DashBot instance, and you're live. See the [plugin README](https://github.com/wembledev/dashbot-openclaw) for setup.

## Testing

```sh
bin/rails test         # Rails (Minitest)
npm test               # Frontend (Vitest)
npm run check          # TypeScript type checking
bin/rubocop            # Ruby linting
bin/ci                 # Full CI suite
```

## Deployment

DashBot deploys as a standard Rails 8 app with SQLite. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for Docker, Kamal, and Dokku instructions.
